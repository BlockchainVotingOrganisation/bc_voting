Link to official documentation

Sphinx makes it easy to link to official TYPO3 documentation:

- :ref:`TYPO3 Tutorial for Editors <t3editors:start>`
- :ref:`Getting Started Tutorial <t3start:start>`

and you may even link to a very specific chapter explaining how to within the TypoScript Reference.

For a complete reference of available cross-link prefixes, please consult file ``_make/conf.py``.
